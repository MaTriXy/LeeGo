                        LeeGo is a Swift framework that helps you decouple & modularise your UI component into small pieces of LEGO style's bricks. Try to make iOS UI development declarative, configurable and highly reusable. LeeGo may help  you with:
                        * Describe your whole UI into small pieces of Lego style’s bricks. Let you configure your view as a `brick` whenever & wherever you want.
                        * No longer need to deal with a bunch of custom UIView’s subclasses. Instead, you only need to deal with different `Brick`s which is lightweight and pure value type.
                        * Designed to be UIKit friendly and non-intrusive. There is no need to inherit from other base class at all.
                        * Capable to update remotely almost everything via your JSON payload.
                        * Built-in convenience methods to make UIStackView like layout hassle-free.
                        * Built-in **self-sizing mechanism** to calculate cell’s height automatically.
                        * Benefits from Swift’s enum, let you put the whole UI in a single enum file.
